    </Strong>

    <h2>Foundation and Early Years</h2>
    <p>The club was founded on <strong>March 9, 1908</strong>, as <em>Foot-Ball Club Internazionale</em> following a
        schism from the Milan Cricket and Football Club. A group of Italians and Swiss broke away from Milan due to
        dissatisfaction with the domination of Italians in the Milan team. They created Internazionale, a club open to
        players of all nationalities. The name "Internazionale" reflects their desire to accept foreign players without
        limits.</p>

    <h2>Ambrosiana-Inter</h2>
    <p>In the 1920s, Inter faced financial challenges and merged with Unione Sportiva Milanese, becoming <em>Società
            Sportiva Ambrosiana</em>. During this period, they wore white shirts with a red cross inspired by Milan's
        flag and coat of arms. However, supporters continued to call them Inter. In 1931, the name changed to
        <em>Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana-Inter</em>.</p>

    <h2>Rise to Prominence</h2>
    <p>Inter's first Scudetto (championship) came in <strong>1910</strong>. They won their second in
        <strong>1920</strong>. Legendary players like Giuseppe Meazza contributed to their success. Inter's performance
        in Italian football continued to improve.</p>

    <h2>European Success</h2>
    <p>Inter won the European Cup/Champions League twice consecutively in <strong>1964</strong> and
        <strong>1965</strong>. Their third Champions League victory came in <strong>2010</strong>, completing an
        unprecedented Italian treble with the Coppa Italia and Scudetto.</p>

    <h2>San Siro Stadium and Rivalries</h2>
    <p>Inter's home games are played at the <em>San Siro stadium</em>, shared with city rivals AC Milan. The stadium has
        a capacity of <strong>75,817</strong>. Inter has fierce rivalries with Milan (Derby della Madonnina) and
        Juventus (Derby d'Italia).</p>

    <h2>Legacy and Ownership</h2>
    <p>Inter is the only Italian club to have always competed in the top flight since its debut in
        <strong>1909</strong>. The club has won <strong>36 domestic trophies</strong>, including twenty league titles,
        nine Coppa Italia, and eight Supercoppa Italiana. Since <strong>2016</strong>, Inter has been majority-owned by
        Chinese holding company Suning Holdings Group.</p>

    <h2>Recent Achievements</h2>

        football. The team's tactical flexibility and strong squad depth have allowed them to remain competitive in both
        domestic and European competitions. Notably, Inter secured the Serie A title in the <strong>2020-2021</strong>
        season, ending Juventus' nine-year dominance in the league.</p>
