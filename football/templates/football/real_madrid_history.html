    </Strong>
    <h2>Foundation and Early Years</h2>
    <p>Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897[^1^][3]. The club was officially
        founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909[^1^][3]. It was originally named Madrid
        Football Club; it wasn't until 1920 that King Alfonso XIII bestowed them with the title of "real" – or "royal"
        in English[^2^][1][^3^][2]. These early years were reasonably successful for Real, as evidenced by their four
        consecutive Copa del Rey victories from 1905 to 1908[^2^][1][^3^][2].</p>

    <h2>The Bernabéu Era</h2>
    <p>The post-war period saw Santiago Bernabéu Yeste take over as the club's president[^2^][1]. Faced with a difficult
        task of rebuilding the club, Bernabéu went on to construct a brand-new stadium – later renamed as the Santiago
        Bernabéu stadium – and sign a number of high-profile international players in order to compete at the European
        stage[^2^][1]. With a bonafide dream team centered around the talents of Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás and
        Francisco Gento, Real cruised to four La Ligas and one Copa del Rey by the end of the 60s[^2^][1]. More
        impressively, they claimed the first five European Cups ever organized, handily destroying any opposition in
        their path from 1956 to 1960[^2^][1].</p>

    <h2>Recent Success</h2>
    <p>In addition to their domestic success, Real Madrid's reputation as a major club was established by their
        outstanding record in the European Cup. To date, they have been crowned champions of Europe a record fourteen
        times[^2^][1][^3^][2]. They have also won the UEFA Cup twice and were twice runners-up in the European Cup
        Winners' Cup[^3^][2].</p>

    <h2>Notable Players</h2>
    <p>Many of the best players in the world have played in the clubs white shirts, including legends like Alfredo Di
        Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, Butragueño, Michel, Hugo Sánchez, Fernando Redondo, Luís Figo, Zinedine
        Zidane, Roberto Carlos, Raúl González, Kaká, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale[^2^][1].</p>
