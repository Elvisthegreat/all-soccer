    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Foundation and Early Years</h2>
        <p>Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. It was originally named Madrid Football Club; it wasn't until 1920 that King Alfonso XIII bestowed them with the title of "real" – or "royal" in English. These early years were reasonably successful for Real, as evidenced by their four consecutive Copa del Rey victories from 1905 to 1908.</p>

        <h2>The Bernabéu Era</h2>
        <p>The post-war period saw Santiago Bernabéu Yeste take over as the club's president. Faced with a difficult task of rebuilding the club, Bernabéu went on to construct a brand-new stadium – later renamed as the Santiago Bernabéu stadium – and sign a number of high-profile international players in order to compete at the European stage. With a bonafide dream team centered around the talents of Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás and Francisco Gento, Real cruised to four La Ligas and one Copa del Rey by the end of the 60s. More impressively, they claimed the first five European Cups ever organized, handily destroying any opposition in their path from 1956 to 1960.</p>

To date, they have been crowned champions of Europe a record fourteen times. They have also won the UEFA Cup twice and were twice runners-up in the European Cup Winners' Cup.</p>
